MSDV Data Structures Fall 2021

Assingment 1
I utilized the stater code given to us and edited the information to pull the necessary data from the first link to create the .txt file. 

Once I was sure that worked, I copied and pasted the code, then edited it to retreieve the data from the next link. I did this each time until all of the data from each of the links was retrieved.
