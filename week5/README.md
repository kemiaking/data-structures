## Part One: Plan
### Using the Hills text as a starting point (but feel free to strike out on your own), draw a data model for your "Process Blog" data to be stored in this database table. Include all the content/data/variables from your "Process Blog" project that you believe to be relevant. Upload an image (png format) of your drawing to your GitHub repository.

I based mine off of movie reviews. I figured a typical movie review has the title of the movie, the year it was made, the director's name, the rating, and the movie poster.
I also added in a heart, just based off whether the reviewer (in this case me) likes the movie, regardless of the rating. So a movie, based on its technical aspects (cinematography, production value, plot, costume, etc.) could be given a low score, but if the review still enjoyed watching it, it could get a heart. Think of the Twilight movies lol

## Part Two: Create some data and test its fit in Word
### Using Word, populate three dummy NoSQL database entries that represent various plausible Process Blog entries (it's ok to use Lorem Ipsum for the text).

This is an example of how my word documents with the movie reviews are laid out.
